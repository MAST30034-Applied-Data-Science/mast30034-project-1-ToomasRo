**Research Goal:** My research goal is to predict the number of trips starting in each of the New York City taxi zones.

**Instructions** 

To run the pipeline, please visit the `scripts` directory and run the files in order:
1. `download.py`: This downloads the raw data into the `data/raw` directory.
2. Go to the `notebooks` directory and run the files in order:
2. `cleaning.ipynb`: This notebook details all preprocessing steps and outputs it to the `data/curated` directory.
3. `modelling2.ipynb`: This notebook is used to conduct analysis on the curated data.
4. `visualising.ipynb` is used to make visualisations that did not have a logical place elsewhere.

`modelling.ipynb` is deprecated and should not be run.
